katrain.po doesn't update when pip3 install

Is there a better way to build than pip3 install?

It uses wheel to build.  I also noted that python katrain doesn't seem to rebuild the kivy files.

Improvements
Add Winrate Loss
Add better theme for bluedot
Better move guessing with something for getting close


@staticmethod
def player_sign(player):
    return {"B": 1, "W": -1, None: 0}[player]

if win_rate is not None:
    return f"{'B' if win_rate > 0.5 else 'W'} {max(win_rate,1-win_rate):.1%}"


WinRate Lost
